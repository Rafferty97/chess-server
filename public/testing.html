						<h1>The Rules Of Chess</h1>
						<p>The player controlling the white pieces is named "White"; the player controlling the black pieces is named "Black". White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required; it is not legal to skip a move, even when having to move is detrimental. Play continues until a king is checkmated, a player resigns, or a draw is declared, as explained below. In addition, if the game is being played under a time control players who exceed their time limit lose the game.

	The official chess rules do not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round-robin tournament) or, in the case of non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open and reveal their color. Play then commences with white.

	The white pawns can move to the squares marked "×" in front of them. The pawn on c6 can also take either black rook.
	Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement. A piece moves to a vacant square except when capturing an opponent's piece.

	Except for any move of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is captured (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square (en passant is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game.[1] The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).

	The king moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A special move with the king known as castling is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).
	A rook moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal or vertical direction. It also is moved when castling.
	A bishop moves any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.
	The queen moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction.
	A knight moves to the nearest square not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an "L" pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces: it jumps to the new location.
	Pawns have the most complex rules of movement:
	A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.
	Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant).
	The pawn is also involved in the two special moves en passant and promotion (Schiller 2003:17–19).

	Positions of the king and rook after kingside (White) and queenside (Black) castling
	Main article: Castling
	Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it.[2] Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:

	The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved;
	There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;
	The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square);
	The king and the rook must be on the same rank (Schiller 2003:19).[3]
	En passant
	Main article: En passant
	Three images showing en passant. First, a white pawn moves from the a2-square to a4; then, the black pawn moves from b4 to a3; finally, the white pawn on a4 is removed
	When a pawn advances two squares from its original square and ends the turn adjacent to a pawn of the opponent's on the same rank, it may be captured by that pawn of the opponent's, as if it had moved only one square forward. This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the first pawn's advance. The diagrams on the right demonstrate an instance of this: if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it en passant, moving from b4 to a3 while the white pawn on a4 is removed from the board.

	Pawn promotion
	Main article: Promotion (chess)
	If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then promoted (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is usually chosen). The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns are promoted. If the desired piece is not available, the player should call the arbiter to provide the piece (Schiller 2003:17–19).[4]

	Black's king is in check. He can get out of check by moving his king to an unattacked square, by moving the bishop to e5 or the knight to f4 to block the check, or by capturing the white bishop with the knight. (Harkness 1967)
	Main article: Check (chess)
	A king is in check when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver check to the opposing player.

	A player may not make any move which places or leaves his king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:

	Move the king to a square where it is not threatened.
	Capture the threatening piece (possibly with the king).
	Block the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece (Just 2014), (Polgar & Truong 2005:32,103), (Burgess 2009:550).
	If it is not possible to get out of check, the king is checkmated and the game is over (see the next section).

	In informal games, it is customary to announce "check" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. However, in formal competitions check is rarely announced (Just 2014).
